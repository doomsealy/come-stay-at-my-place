        "text": "The Best Sound Team in St. Lucia!\n\nWorking with DJ Big Slim and his team was an absolute dream! Sound was one of the most important aspects of our wedding—especially for a Haitian wedding where music and energy are everything—and they delivered flawlessly.\n\nThe sound quality was crystal clear and perfectly balanced, making every moment—from the ceremony to the party—feel like a world-class production. As the groom is a DJ and sound engineer, having top-tier sound was non-negotiable, and DJ Big Slim did not disappoint!\n\nEven though we had our own DJ, we would hire this team in a heartbeat for DJ services because their energy and professionalism are unmatched. Not only did they handle our sound seamlessly, but the entire team partied and vibed with us, which made the experience that much more special.\n\nIf you want a worry-free, unforgettable, and next-level sound experience, this is hands down the best sound company on the island!",

        "text": "DJ Bigg Slim was EVERYTHING!\nWe had the absolute best time at our wedding at the Royalton Saint Lucia, and a huge part of that was thanks to DJ Bigg Slim. He MADE the night! From start to finish, the energy was incredible—our friends and family were on the dance floor the entire time. He was not only so fun but also incredibly professional.\n\nWe gave him a general idea of the music we were into, and he completely understood our vibe. He pulled out the perfect songs, kept the momentum going all night, and made sure everyone—young and old—was having a blast. The transitions were smooth, the song choices were spot-on, and when the night was supposed to end, he even gave us a few encore tracks to keep the party going just a little longer.\n\nWe seriously couldn't have imagined a better night or a better DJ. If you're lucky enough to have DJBiggSlim at your event—prepare for a wild time. Five stars isn't enough!\n\nThank you!!\nSarah & Chris",
